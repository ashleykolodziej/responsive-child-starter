/**
 * An example of how a "partial" works in JavaScript.
 *
 * Just like with Sass partials, in modern JavaScript, you can write
 * smaller chunks of related code in a file, and include them in other
 * files as you need them. JavaScript uses the term "modules" for this.
 *
 * Learn more about modules here:
